# Welcome to whirlwind

Whirlwind is an easy-to-use **MVC** framework written in **Python** that makes efficient use
of some of the fastest server-side and client-side technologies in an organized fashion. The goal of whirlwind is to speed up the configuration and development of scalable and efficient web applications. It's the glue for the seamless deployment of a combination of some useful parts of [well-known and robust technologies](https://github.com/trendrr/whirlwind/wiki/Credits). 

The code base of whirlwind was originally developed as the underlying web framework for the
social media metrics and analytics platform [**Trendrr**](http://trendrr.com).
